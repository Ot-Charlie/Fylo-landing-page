### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned


```css
main {
  background-image: url("./images/bg-curvy-desktop.svg"),
    linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      transparent 850px,
      /* transparent at top till 860px*/ hsl(218, 28%, 13%) 850px
        /* color starts at 860px */
    );
  background-size: 100% auto; /*full width and auto height scales proportionally*/
  background-position: center 25%; /* horizontally centered and 25% from the top*/
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```



### Continued development
I want to keep getting better at building websites. In particular I want to work on my speed and also learn how to replicate pixel perfect designs.
